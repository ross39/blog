title: Editor wars

Programmers take their code editing experience very seriously and for good reason. The editor is where you craft your solutions and where you debug 
those pesky errors. Its where the magic happens. Of course not all of your time is spent hacking away in your editor, you have to Google stuff and figure
out what it is that you don't know. Knowing what you don't know is an art in and of itself. However a lot of developers, especially those new developers, are 
very opinionated on the editors they use. IDE's?? ewww, use vim instead. Ha! look at that guy over there using emacs, ever heard of VScode buddy? It almost seems 
to be a tribal thing, which editing tribe you belong to. However the truth is that the magic can happen in any editor ðŸ¤¯. The editor you use matters very little. I 
remember first starting out and seeing people with a bunch of terminals opened up, with fully riced tmux, vim and i3wm. I thought those poeple were the real deal. They 
must know so much more than me. That's clearly nonsense. Provided the editor you choose has the features you desire, it doesn't matter whether it's VScode,
Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Intellij etc. Any editor is great but for the love of god, please don't subject yourself to NetBeans.
