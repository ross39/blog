title: AI is just compression
---

AI is just compression is a delightful idea and an idea that makes a lot of sense when you think about it(don't worry, I will explain as best I can). The idea is the driver behind the [Hutter Prize](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hutter_Prize) which aims to compress
human knowledge. At first it seems quite outlandish, AI shouldn't really have much to do with compression but being able to take in a torrent of information and efficiently condense it in some representation is almost intelligence[^1]. In a way thats what humans do 
all the time, we take in large quantities of information and compress it efficiently. A prime example would be if you were studying for a exam, you need to somehow store that knowledge in an efficient manner inside your brain so you can achieve the desired outcome and
pass the test. As humans we have obligations/constraints imposed on us and this requires us to process information from different sources quickly and store the representation as efficiently as possible for later use. An example would be a parent who must process what their
child is doing while driving a vechicle and mentally processing work tasks/other things. It's optimal to use compression to store information in the brain. It's extremely interesting that two seemingly unrealated ideas are in fact closely related. For more information check

[^1]: I say almost intelligent as if we're talking about a general AI then I believe more will have to be present than just compression for a general AI
